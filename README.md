# Trees_Tents_Tantrums
## Description of My Project
The intention of this project is to eventually use it as a way to promote and add interest to a book, that may or may not get written, about my family's and another family's Thru-Hike of the Appalachian Trail. It consists of an About page, a Gallery, the footer has links to our Youtube channel and Facebook, and I plan to add a contact page. The About page doesn't contain any actual informational content as of now, but the goal is: the first/top section will give an overview of our thru-hike and what Trees Tents & Tantrums is, the second/bottom section will contain information exclusivly on the Appalachian Trail. "About the Appalachian Trail" is also where I'm using JavaScript in a modal of "Fun Trail Facts!".
